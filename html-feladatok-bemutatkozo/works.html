				<h2>100 kilometer run</h2>
				<div class="workInfo">Completed in 02.29.2020</div>
				<p>
					This arduous challenge took me 13 hours and 15 minutes to complete.
					The trip started from Győr at 6 am. I traversed the distance all the
					way to the Turul statue at Tatabánya and from there to Bicske. The feat was done completely alone. The picture below was taken by my brother who had been waiting for me at the final destination.
				</p>
				<h3>Things to note</h3>
				<p>
					Excluding previous training, the run required about a week of preparation.
					<ul>
						<li>memorizing the route and taking pictures of important intersections (I had no access to mobile internet during the run)</li>
						<li>calculating calorie intake, magnesium loss, vitamin needs etc.</li>
						<li>organizing a compact and small backpack, which included basic first aid, change of clothes, extra wamrth if needed, food, isotonic concentrate and of course water flasks.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<h3>Circumstances</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>8<span>&#8451;</span></li>
					<li>clear weather</li>
					<li>sides of roads for most of the distance</li>
					<li>got lost at Kocs for 30 minutes on the dirt roads</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Post run condition</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>feverish (which subsided in 2 hours)</li>
					<li>nauseous</li>
					<li>lots of pain</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Next day</h3>
				<p>Since I wanted to complete 135 kilometers during that weekend (the distance between Győr and Budapest), I covered the rest of the 35 kilometers on the Margaret Island next day. This concludes my achievement.(For more pictures, see gallery)</p>

				<p>The race took place in Nagyatád and took me about 15 hours to complete. If you look closely you can see that I am completely covered in salt my body had been producing. Needless to say, this challenge was trying and took all my mental fortitude to push on even when it was hard to just walk. During the race I got sunburnt, had a fever, got extremely sleepy, struggled with constant muscle cramps and was utterly spent.</p>

				<p>42,2 kilometers completed in 3:16:30. I expected to cover the distance in 3:30; however, to my surprise (and immense joy) I vastly outperformed and exceeded this expectation. I replicated the performance at the Ultra Balaton event a week later, where 40 kilometers took me 3:02 to run.</p>
